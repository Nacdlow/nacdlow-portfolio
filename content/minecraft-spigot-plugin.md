This is a [Bukkit]/[Spigot] [Minecraft] server plugin, which allows us to sync
aspects of the simulated iglü environment in a Minecraft game world. We did
this instead of building our own custom simulation environment, whether that be
a simple interface or a custom simulation game.

This allowed us to save a lot of time in simulating, as Minecraft is a game
which is easy to extend.
