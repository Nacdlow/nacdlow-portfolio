## Who are we?

We are a group of six students from Heriot-Watt University, tasked to create
the smart home system of the future as a part of the third year Software
Engineering and Professional Development course.

The project started late September 2019, and we completed at the end of April
2020, at a time where COVID-19 related restrictions are imposed.

You can read our final [stage 3 report](/nacdlow-stage-3-report.pdf), which
describes the functional requirements, market research, group organisation,
application user guide, and much more. Also check out our [marketing website]
which was submitted with the project.

We also created an animated [mini-documentary] where the group members
explained how the system works, including the Minecraft demo.

## What have we built
During the **7 months**, we have created many sub-projects which is a part of
this system. Some projects are plugins (based on the plugin SDK we built),
others are tools we built for ourselves to help us during the development of
this project.

The following is the repositories we have created. Click on them to get more
details and demonstrations of the program.
